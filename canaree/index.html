    <p>The US intelligence community holds unique information about foreign
      nation cyberattackers, which is not available to private companies trying
      to defend themselves. We propose adopting recent secure enclave technology
      to apply classified intelligence in non-classified settings, while
      maintaining intelligence secrecy. We suggest the development of a
      <b>classified threat sensor</b> that US companies can run in enclaves without
      leaking classified intelligence or private security data.</p>
      <p>We call this design <b>CANAREE</b> for <b>Classified Analysis of
        Network Attacks in a Restricted Execution Environment</b>.</p>

      <h4>The Information Sharing Challenge</h4>

      <p>Foreign nation-state cyberattacks against US-based companies create a
      national security risk and result in the loss of competitive intellectual
      property. The US intelligence community holds classified information that
      could help detect nation state attacks. However, that intelligence cannot
      be shared without risking sources and methods. Private security data held
      by industry, which might not be accessible due to regulatory or public
      perception issues, could in turn aid intelligence agencies in identifying
      broader attack campaigns.</p>

      <p>Today, the time to declassify information and share it through existing
      channels may reduce intelligence’s relevance by the time a company can act
      on it. Recent developments in secure enclave technology may empower
      companies and governments to rapidly act on classified intelligence,
      without requiring declassification.</p>

      <h4>Secure Enclaves &amp; Classified Threat Sensors</h4>

      <p>Secure enclaves are an off-the-shelf technology that provides a safe
      space to run audited software and process secret data on someone else’s
      computer. We propose using secure enclaves to operate classified threat
      sensors that run on a private company’s servers. These threat sensors
      would be able to scan a company’s local security data for signs of
      cyberattack or classified vulnerabilities without revealing the indicators
      for which the sensor was searching.</p>

      <p>Classified threat sensors solve the information sharing challenge
      without declassifying intelligence or exposing private data to
      governments. They may be built from off-the-shelf technology using
      existing open source tools. These sensors could speed detection and
      attribution of cyberattacks by foreign powers. Sensors can also act as an
      early-warning system to discover broader campaigns, without exposing
      private company data to the government.</p>

      <h4>Rollout Plan</h4>

      <p>We suggest a phased trial between the National Security Agency (NSA),
      Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and private industry partners.
      Secure enclave data sharing technology is already funded through the <a
      href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/cybersecurity-impact">DHS’s
      IMPACT</a> program’s <a href="https://galois.com/project/fides/">Galois
      FIDES Project</a>. The NSA also proposed a very similar design in a paper, 
      <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7070089">"Using Classified Intelligence to Defend Unclassified Networks"</a>

      
      This technology can be migrated to an open source
      project, then run in parallel trial deployments for both
      industry-to-industry and government-to-government sharing between the NSA
      and DHS. After proven in trials, a government-to-industry sharing program
      could be deployed between DHS and industry partners. See the
      <a href="canaree-operational-plan.pdf">CANAREE Operational Plan</a> for
      more details.</p>
      
      <h4>Open Source Grant Proposal</h4>
      
      <p>The first phase of the rollout plan to build an open source prototype
      could be developed by student researchers using existing open source
      projects, such as the Intel's <a
      href="https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx"> Linux SGX SDK</a>, Intel's <a
      href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/code-sample-intel-software-guard-extensions-remote-attestation-end-to-end-example">
      remote attestation examples</a>, Baidu's <a
      href="https://github.com/baidu/rust-sgx-sdk">Rust SGX SDK</a>, Microsoft
      <a href="https://github.com/openenclave/">OpenEnclave</a>, RedHat <a
      href="https://enarx.io">Enarx</a>, or <a
      href="https://github.com/lsds/TaLoS">TaLoS</a> TLS termination. Both
      Microsoft <a
      href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/enclavedb-a-secure-database-using-sgx/">EnclaveDB</a>
      and  <a
      href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/shielding-applications-from-an-untrusted-cloud-with-haven/">Haven</a>
      may provide design insight.</p>         
        
      <p>This work could be conducted by 2 graduate or undergraduate students
      for 1 semester and overseen by a 1/4 time Principal Investigator (PI). We
      estimate that $150K would cover the student costs, PI, equipment,
      conference travel, and indirect university overhead. See the
      <a href="canaree-grant.pdf">CANAREE Open Source Grant Proposal</a> for
      more details.</p>
