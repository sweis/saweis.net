          Homomorphic Encryption Scheme</a><br />
          C Gentry<br />
          PhD Thesis, 2009<br />

          <p>Craig Gentry presented the first fully homomorphic encryption
          scheme, which allows both multiplication and addiition operations
          between encrypted data. Partially homomorphic encryption schemes that
          exclusively allowed one operation or the other were well known, but
          it was a long outstanding problem whether a cryptosystem could
          support both operations.</p>

          T Ristenpart, E Tromer, H Shacham, S Savage<br />
          CCS, 2009<br />

          <p>This paper discusses how to target a VM running on an
          infrastructure as a service provider (namely EC2), and place another
          VM on the same host. It then shows how a co-tenant VM can then be
          used to mount cross-VM side-channel attacks, which extract
          information from the target VM.</p>

          CCS, 2011<br />

          <p>This paper presents a tool, Stowaway, which can analyze Android
          apps and determine which API calls they are using. Stowaway then
          determines whether apps are overprivileged. The paper found that was
          the case for a third out of a sample of 940 apps.</p>

          Attribute-Based Encryption: An Expressive, Efficient, and Provably
          Secure Realization</a><br />
          B Waters<br />
          Public Key Cryptography, 2011<br />

          <p>This paper presents a more efficient construction of an
          Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) scheme. ABE schemes essentially
          allow an encryptor to specify how to share data by expressing an
          access control policy in the algorithm itself.</p>

          Usenix Security 2011<br />

          <p>This paper presents the <i>ded</i> decompiler, which recovers
          Android app source code from the installation image. They performed
          static analysis on 21 million lines of recovered code, yet found no
          evidence of malware or exploitable vulnerabilities.</p>

          M van Dijk, C Gentry, S Halevi, V Vaikuntanathan<br />
          Eurocrypt 2010<br />

          <p>This paper presents a "somewhat homomorphic" encryption scheme
          using basic modular arithmetic, then uses Craig Gentry's techniques
          to convert it to a fully homomorphic scheme. This is conceptually
          simpler than Gentry's original fully homomorphic scheme.</p>

          JA Halderman, SD Schoen, N Heninger, W Clarkson, W Paul, JA
          Calandrino, AJ Feldman, J Applebaum, E Felton<br />
          Usenix Security, 2008<br />

          <p>The "cold boot" paper: The authors demonstrate how to recover data
          remnants from frozen DRAM modules. They then analyze the recovered
          contents to extract encryption keys and circumvent popular disk
          encryption systems.</p>

          Structure-Independent Botnet Detection.</a><br />
          G Gu, R Perdisci, J Zhang, W Lee<br />
          Usenix Security, 2008<br />

          <p>This paper presents a botnet detection framework that is
          independent of a specific botnet command &amp; control protocol or
          structure. The authors implemented BotMinder and were able to
          successfully detect traces of live botnets.</p>

          IEEE Security &amp; Privacy 2008 and 2009<br />

          <p>Both of these papers cover de-anonymizing large sets of supposedly
          anonymized data. The first paper de-anonymizes the the Netflix Prize
          data set while the second paper links accounts between Twitter and
          Flickr.</p>

          Eurocrypt, 2010<br />

          <p>This paper gives two constructions of secure functional encryption
          schemes: one is an attribute-based encryption scheme and the other is
