    <hr />
    <p>Whenever a controversy about the National Security Agency (NSA) arises among the cryptographic community, it
      resurfaces a question that has been open for 25 years: How were the NIST ECDSA curve parameters generated?</p>

    <p>ECDSA is the most widely used elliptic curve cryptography standard in practice. It originated
      in the 1999
      <a href="https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/grouper.ieee.org/groups/1363/private/x9-62-09-20-98.pdf">ANSI X9.62 ECDSA</a>
      specifications and were adopted by NIST in 2000 as part of the
      <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/files/pubs/fips/186-2/final/docs/fips186-2.pdf">FIPS 186-2 Digital Signature
        Standard</a>.
      Both specifications list a set of standard elliptic curves of varying sizes and security levels. For curves over
      prime fields, the specifications published a "seed" parameter whose hash value is used to define the other
      parameters of the curve. The provenance of these X9.62 seeds was 
      <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/sci.crypt/c/mFMukSsORmI/m/FpbHDQ6hM_MJ">questioned almost immediately</a> 
      on Usenet after publication in 1999.
    </p>
    <p>
      These seed parameters were provided by the NSA and appear in the specifications with no explanation or
      justification. An example is the NIST P-256 curve seed:
      <code>SEED = C49D3608 86E70493 6A6678E1 139D26B7 819F7E90</code>. Why
      <i>this value</i> and not another? Revelations of NSA interference in cryptographic
      standards like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG">Dual_EC_DRBG</a> led to speculation of whether 
      the NIST curve seeds could have been intentionally chosen with a weakness or backdoor known only to the NSA.
    </p>
    <h3>Who provided the seeds?</h3>
    <p><a href="https://sites.math.washington.edu/~koblitz/">Neal Koblitz</a> and 
      <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/ajmeneze">Alfred Menezes</a> wrote an excellent summary on this controversy, 
      <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1018.pdf">"A Riddle Wrapped in an Enigma"</a>, which discusses the history 
      and concerns around the seed values. Prof. Menezes was also the primary author of the ANSI X9.62 ECDSA standard. 
      I contacted Prof. Menezes about where the seeds originated and he definitively answered at least who provided them:
      <b>Jerry Solinas</b> from the NSA. 
    </p>
    <blockquote><i>"Jerry Solinas did provide the seeds to me sometime in Fall 1997. At the time,
        I was the primary author of the ANSI X9.62 ECDSA standard, and Jerry was
        attending the standards meetings as an NSA representative. I don't know
        if Jerry selected the seeds himself, but in any case he was the person
        who contributed the seeds to the ANSI standards committee. (Jerry is the
        "NSA representative" mentioned on <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1018">page 8 of my article</a> with Neal
        Koblitz.)"</i>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Jerry Solinas was a long time employee of the NSA who authored multiple cryptographic standards and
      <a
        href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/search?name=&sort=&rfcs=on&activedrafts=on&by=author&author=Solinas">RFCs</a>.
      Based on Menezes' account, Solinas provided the curve seeds as part of the X9.62 standards meeting.
      Dr. Solinas providing the seeds had been mentioned in several secondary sources and it's the first 
      time I've heard someone with direct knowledge corroborate it. Unfortunately, Dr. Solinas died in early
      2023 without publicly saying how the curve seeds were generated.
    </p>
    <h3>How were the seeds generated?</h3>
    <p>
      <b>We don't know</b> and probably won't know unless we find some documentation or a contemporary of Jerry Solinas
      who directly knows. In 2018, I tried to submit FOIA requests to both NIST and the NSA for any documents related to
      the choice of elliptic curves over prime fields. NIST claimed they had no documentation and the NSA ceased
      responding. These requests could likely be improved and reworded to have a better chance of finding something:

 request to NIST</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a
 href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/origin-of-fips-186-4-elliptic-curves-over-prime-field-seed-parameters-national-security-agency-78755/">FOIA
 request to NSA</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Verifiably at Random?</h3>
    <p>
      Jerry Solinas' own <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4753">RFC 4753</a> says that the NIST curve's groups
      were <i>"chosen verifiably at random using SHA-1 as specified in IEEE-1363 from the seed"</i>. That method is outlined in 
      <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/891000">IEEE 1363</a> Section A.12.4 and is paraphrased as:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose an <b>arbitrary</b> bit string X of bit length L.</li>
      <li>Compute seed = H(X).</li>
      <li>Derive the curve and test if it has prime order.</li>
      <li>Repeat if not.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note that the IEEE 1363 specification, which Dr. Solinas directly said he used, does not specify that the seed pre-image X 
      need to be random. Arbitrary means arbitrary.
    </p>

    <h3>The Lost Passphrase Story</h3>
    <p>
      I asked a few contemporaries of Jerry Solinas who were involved in cryptographic standards in the late 1990s. 
      One person who has worked on several cryptographic standards and is unaffiliated with the NSA told me
      a relevant anecdote. They wished to remain anonymous:
    </p>
    <blockquote><i>"It was Jerry Solinas. I spoke to him about this very topic at least ten years ago [circa 2013].
        [Jerry] told me that he used a seed that was something like:<br />
        <code>SEED = SHA1("Jerry deserves a raise.")</code><br />
        After he did the work, his machine was replaced or upgraded, and the actual phrase that he used was lost.<br />
        When the controversy first came up, Jerry tried every phrase that he could think of that was similar to this,
        but none matched."</i>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This corroborates hearsay from Dan Bernstein and Tanja Lange in these
      <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/files/pubs/sp/800/186/final/docs/sp800-186-draft-comments-received.pdf">comments
        submitted to NIST</a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>"I have heard NSA employees claiming that the "random" inputs were actually generated as hashes of 
        English text chosen (and later forgotten) by Jerry Solinas."</i>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A third person who was affiliated with the NSA after Dr. Solinas' time repeated the anecdote, but heard it as a rumor 
      repeated by someone else and did not have any direct knowledge. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Since posting this, a fourth person came forward saying that in 2013, Dr. Solinas recalled to them that the seed phrase
      had <i>two names</i> in it, like "Give Alice and Bob a raise.". Another source said that Dr. Solinas mentioned the phrase may
      contain a counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does this contradict what Solinas said in his RFCs? I don't think so. If an "arbitrary" bit string is really arbitrary, 
      a plain English phrase would suffice. That would technically be following IEEE 1363. You could hash passphrases until one 
      generates a curve of sufficient order. 
    </p>
    <p>Summarizing all the rumors: The pre-seed phrases are English phrases which mention Jerry Solinas, possibly someone else, 
      and possibly a counter. An example guess might be <code>SEED = SHA1("Jerry and Bob need raises123")</code>.
    </p>
    <h3>Minghua Qu and the X9.62 Field<sub>2<sup>m</sup></sub> Curve Seeds</h3>
    <p>In the appendix below, I pasted all the seeds from the 
      <a href="https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/grouper.ieee.org/groups/1363/private/x9-62-09-20-98.pdf">September 20, 1998 
        version of the X9.62 specification</a>. You can see that there are many that share repeated or bit-shifted byte values
        for Field<sub>2<sup>m</sup></sub> curves. Specifically <code>4D696 E6768756 15175</code> is repeated in 8 seeds. 
        This has been <a href="https://dissect.crocs.fi.muni.cz/standards/secg">noticed</a> multiple times before. 
        These bytes are the ASCII encoding of the string <code>MinghuaQu</code>. Minghua Qu is a cryptography who 
        worked at Certicom at the time and is a co-author of Alfred Menezes on the 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQV">MQV</a> key agreement protocol. 
      This is good evidence that the Field<sub>2<sup>m</sup></sub> seeds are <b>not</b> based on hashes of any plaintext strings.
      </p>
    <h3>What next?</h3>
      <p>
        It's unsatisfying to have a few second-hand and off-the-the record anecdotes about how the seeds were generated.
        At the very least, it would be good to corroborate that the seeds are hashes of English phrases that were lost,
        either from documentation or someone with first hand knowledge at the NSA. One person to ask is Laurie E. Law, 
        who was a co-author of Jerry Solinas on papers and RFCs from at least
        <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/money/nsamint/nsamint.htm">1996</a>
        to <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6379">2011</a>. I did not find any contact information for
        her and she
        is likely long retired.
      </p>
      <p>
        A long shot chance is to try to bruteforce guess short English phrases and see if any collide with a seed
        from the specifications.  If English phrases were used, there would have been many of them for all the 
        examples in the X9.62 specification. IEEE 1363's method of generating curves was a trial &amp; error 
        approach. If might expect each pre-seed value to include a descriptor or a counter. However, the anecdote 
        I heard claimed that Jerry Solinas tried remembering his own phrases after the fact and failed, so this is
        probably not worth the effort without more information.
      </p>
      <p>Some open questions &amp; comments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The "MinghuaQu" seeds co-mingled with the eventual NIST seeds in the same X9.62 document makes a conspiracy to
          intentionally weaken the NIST seeds seem less credible. Why would the NSA influence just a few seeds out of a set of
          many, which includes several arbitrary, but perfectly valid joke seeds? 
        </li>
        <li>It was mentioned that Jerry Solinas did a sabbatical at University of Waterloo and/or Certicom? Is that true? If so,
          when was it? One person who was a graduate student at Waterloo in the late 90s recalls seeing Jerry a few times in classrooms
          over a span of about a month.
        </li>
