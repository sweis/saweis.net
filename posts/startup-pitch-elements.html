    <p>These are some of the key elements I want to see in a startup pitch.
      There are many other frameworks like it, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas">Business Model Canvas</a>, the
    <a href="https://guykawasaki.com/the-only-10-slides-you-need-in-your-pitch/">10-slide pitch deck</a>, the
  <a href="https://slidebean.com/templates/investor-deck-template">investor deck template</a>, etc.</p>
  <p> The elements don't need to appear in this strict ordering and should be arranged for your particular narrative.
    If you have a technical team with a unique solution, highlight that. If you have a large market and many prospects,
    highlight that.

        <li><b>Team:</b> What is your team's unique advantage in providing this solution?</li>
        <li><b>Deployment:</b> How do you find prospects? How do you get your solution deployed to those customers?</li>
        <li><b>Prospects:</b> Which specific customers have you engaged? Have they validated your solution? Who are the next 5 to engage?</li>
        <li><b>Finance:</b> Who owns your company and on what terms? How much money do you have? How much are you spending? When do you run out of money?</li>
        <li><b>Pitch:</b> How much money do you need to deploy your solution to your prospects? How far will that get you?</li>
